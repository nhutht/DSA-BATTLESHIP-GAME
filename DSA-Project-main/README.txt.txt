Battleship Game

Introduction:
This project implements the classic Battleship game in Java. Players place their ships on a grid and take turns trying to guess the locations of their opponent's ships to sink them.

 Instructions:

 1. Compilation:
To compile the code, make sure you have Java installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code files (`Battleship.java`).
Compile the code using the following command:

```bash
javac *.java
```

 2. Running the Game:
After compilation, you can run the game using the following command:

```bash
java Battleship
```

 3. Gameplay:
1. Upon starting the game, you will be prompted to place your ships on the grid. Follow the instructions to position your ships horizontally or vertically.
2. After placing all your ships, the game will begin, and you will take turns attacking the computer's grid by selecting grid coordinates.
3. The computer will also take its turns attacking your grid.
4. The game continues until one player sinks all of the opponent's ships.
5. You can restart the game at any time by following the on-screen prompts.

 4. Additional Notes:
- You can modify the game settings and behavior by editing the source code files.
- Make sure to compile the code again if you make any changes before running the game.
