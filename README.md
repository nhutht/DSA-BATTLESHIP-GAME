# DSA-BATTLESHIP-GAME

### Download and Run `DSA-Project-main` Folder Using Visual Studio Code

1. Clone the Repository:
   - Open your web browser and go to [GitHub](https://github.com).
   - Navigate to the repository `battleshipDSAproject/DSA-Project-main`.
   - Click on the green "Code" button to copy the repository URL (HTTPS).
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/username/DSA-Project-main.git
     ```
   - Replace `https://github.com/username/DSA-Project-main.git` with the actual repository URL.

2. Open in Visual Studio Code:
   - Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
   - Click on "File" > "Open..." or press `Ctrl + O` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + O` (Mac).
   - Navigate to the `DSA-Project-main` folder that you cloned and click "Open" to open the project in VSCode.

3. Install Dependencies (if any):
   - If the project requires dependencies (like Java libraries or others), ensure they are installed according to the project's instructions. This might involve running commands like `npm install` or `mvn install`, depending on the project setup.

4. Run the Project:
   - Open the terminal within VSCode by clicking on "Terminal" > "New Terminal" or using `Ctrl + \` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + \` (Mac).
   - Navigate to the directory where your main application file is located. For Java projects, this is typically where your `main` method is defined.
   - Compile and run your project according to the project's build and run instructions. For example:
     ```
     javac MainClass.java  // Compile Java classes
     java MainClass        // Run the compiled Java application
     ```
   - Replace `MainClass` with the actual main class name of your Java application.

5. View Output:
   - Check the output in the terminal to ensure the application runs as expected. Any errors or exceptions will be displayed here.

6. Modify and Experiment:
   - Use VSCode to modify the code as needed. Save the changes, and the IDE will automatically update the files.

By following these steps, you should be able to download the `DSA-Project-main` folder from GitHub, open it in Visual Studio Code, and run the project according to its setup instructions. Adjust the specific commands and paths based on your project's requirements and file structure.
